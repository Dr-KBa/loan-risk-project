# ML model access locally via Streamlit

To access the Model 1 via user-friendly browser-based streamlit interface locally run the following command (assuming streamlit is installed):

streamlit run app.py
    
Everything necessary to run and test the model is configured in the app.py script.
Unique values.txt provides all features and unique values in the order that the Model 1 is expecting.
